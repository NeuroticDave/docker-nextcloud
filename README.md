# docker-nextcloud

This is just like [my ownCloud server Docker container repo](https://github.com/greyltc/docker-owncloud/) only it's for [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com). [Here is some background](http://fortune.com/2016/06/03/what-happened-to-owncloud/) relating to the ownCloud/Nextcloud fissure.

Simple to use Docker container with the latest stable Nextcloud server release, complete with all the bells and whistles. This project is 100% transparent and trustable, every file in the resulting docker image is traceable and inspectable by following up the docker image depenancy tree which starts with [my Arch Linux base image](https://github.com/greyltc/docker-archlinux).

Please report any issues or improvement ideas to [the github issue tracker](https://github.com/greyltc/docker-nextcloud/issues)  
Pull requests welcome! Let's work together!

Say thanks by adding a star [here](https://github.com/greyltc/docker-nextcloud/) and/or [here](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/greyltc/nextcloud/).
